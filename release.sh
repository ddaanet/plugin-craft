#   release.sh [patch|minor|major]   full release
#   release.sh --resume              complete a release that landed partially
#
# A plugin that has never been released is a special case: with no previous
# release to bump forward from, `release.sh` with no bump argument publishes
# the manifest version as it stands. Passing a bump there is refused. See
# release_preflight, which detects this by tag alone: no tag matching
# `^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` exists yet, and the plugin's marketplace entry
# plays no part in that decision.
#
# Run from the plugin root (the directory holding .claude-plugin/plugin.json);
# `just release` does that for you. Requires bash, jq, git, gh, and
# MARKETPLACE_DIR pointing at the claude-plugins repo.

    # memory — a consumer whose vendored plugin-dev/ predates one of them would
    # otherwise be told about an exclusion its own copy does not make.
    #
    # Two paths are exempt, both because an agent session moves them by design
    # between commits.
    #
    # `.claude/` is the repo's own agent working environment — settings, hooks,
    # and the task frames the handoff and precompact skills stage for "whatever
    # commit lands next". None of it is plugin content: a plugin ships
    # .claude-plugin/ and the component directories beside it. Excluded whole
    # rather than by filename, because the set of files written there is a
    # function of which skills the maintainer runs, not of this script. The
    # pathspec matches at the path separator, so .claude-plugin/ — where a dirty
    # file must still stop a release — is untouched by it.
    #
    # The second is a gitlore-mounted memory submodule: its gitlink sits ahead
    # of what HEAD records between commits by design — gitlore's own pre-commit
    # hook folds that in on the next commit, not this one.
    #
    # The mount path is read from .gitmodules rather than assumed to be
    # `memory`: that is only gitlore's default, the path being $1 to gitlore's
    # install.sh. Keyed on the submodule NAME, which gitlore fixes, not its url
    # — git absolutises a relative url on the way into .git/config, so a url
    # only ever matches .gitmodules itself. `--get` of a single key returns the
    # value whole, so a path containing spaces needs no -z splitting.
    #
    # Deliberately this narrow. A consumer that vendors some other submodule
    # and forgets to commit its moved gitlink should be refused, so

    # a same-repo pushurl on a different protocol too.

    # url.<base>.pushInsteadOf is a fourth route and is NOT checked — a stated
    # bound, recorded in docs/references/recovery.md. Set, it sends the push to

    # — unlike these three repo-scoped keys, whose presence is itself the

    # push alike, so the probe reads where the release publishes.

    # 2.47.3; it does not fail). The refusal would then name one of two URLs
    # and advise `--unset`, which refuses a multi-valued key with status 5: a
    # correct refusal handing back a recovery that does not work. The other two
    # keys are last-one-wins for git, but a config file can still hold several
    # lines of them and `--unset` refuses those identically, so all three are
