# Whether this plugin has ever released, to pick the deny wording below.
# 2>/dev/null on the listing: on a CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR that is not a git
# repository at all (the common case pre-release), git's "not a git
# repository" is an expected outcome here, not a diagnostic. This hook is
# silent on stderr whatever it decides, and the toolkit's own test suite
# asserts that against a non-repo project directory.
# A CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR that is not itself a repo but sits inside one
# lists the enclosing repo's tags instead; that only changes the wording
# below, never the deny decision already established above. Same semver
# filter release.sh's semver_tags uses, duplicated rather than sourced:
# release.sh runs its flow at top level and isn't written to be sourced.
#
# A failed listing (git absent, killed, not a repo, ...) is not the same
# answer as an empty one (a repo with no matching tags): the two take
# opposite wordings below, so folding a failure into an empty string would
# answer "never released" for a listing that told us nothing. But every
# status here still has to be absorbed -- the deny is already decided
# above, and a hook that exits non-zero for any reason other than 2 is a
# non-blocking error to Claude Code, so the just-refused edit proceeds.
# Absorbing a status after the deny is fail-closed -- the worst outcome is
# the wrong wording on a refusal that still refuses; propagating one is
# fail-open, exiting non-2 with no stdout so the edit goes through. So the
# listing is read inside an `if` condition and the filter's status is bound
# to its own capture with `||`, both places where errexit is suspended;
# every outcome -- listing failure, filter no-match, and any other filter
# exit -- is turned into a plain variable rather than a status left on the
# table. No pipe is used for either, which also sidesteps pipefail entirely
# instead of reasoning through it (the older piped form's `|| true` did
# have to).

This plugin has never been released -- no vX.Y.Z tag exists yet, so the
manifest is not tracking a previous release. It holds $current, which is
what the initial release will publish, verbatim. Which version a plugin
first ships as is the maintainer's call and their edit to make.

Do not bypass this guard, modify the recipe, or alter version state by

plugin.json version edit refused: $current -> $proposed.

The manifest version is the last released version. It is changed only by
'just release {patch|minor|major}', which validates state, bumps, commits,
tags, and pushes in one step. The release recipe also refuses if plugin.json
and the latest git tag disagree.

If the goal is to ship a release, invoke the recipe instead of editing this
file. Do not bypass this guard, modify the recipe, or alter version state by
